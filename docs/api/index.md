# Introduction


The Counter API does not require any authentication or authorization to use. This means that anyone who has access to the API can access and modify the count data stored in it. As a result, there is no need to use any token or password to access the API. 

This is a significant advantage of the Counter API, as it allows developers to easily integrate count data into their applications without the need for complex authentication and authorization systems.

The API
address is [https://api.counterapi.dev/v1](https://api.counterapi.dev/v1)
