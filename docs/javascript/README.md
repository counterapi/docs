# Introduction


The Counter API is a simple and easy-to-use REST API that allows developers to store and retrieve count data in static applications without the need for a backend. 

With the Counter API, you can easily keep track of user engagement, website traffic, and other important metrics without the need for a database or server. 

The API is available in both JavaScript and Go programming languages, making it easy for developers to integrate it into their projects.
